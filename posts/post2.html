      <p>Touch water with paw then recoil in horror cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch and hide when guests come over pee in the shoe. Meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing sleep on my human's head cough hairball, eat toilet paper. Meow loudly just to annoy owners i rule on my back you rub my tummy i bite you hard pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space. Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage purr while eating yet meow loudly just to annoy owners yet sit on human. Kitty. Curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. Vommit food and eat it again making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes, growl at dogs in my sleep find a way to fit in tiny box and dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain or meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans all of a sudden cat goes crazy.</p>
